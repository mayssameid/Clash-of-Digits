HOW TO TEST THE DEPLOYMENT
===============================================

PART 1: TEST LOCALLY FIRST (Before Deploying)
===============================================

1. Start your server:
   npm start
   
2. Open browser: http://localhost:3000

3. Test each feature:
   ☐ Homepage loads with all styling
   ☐ Navigate to different pages (About, Arena, Leaderboard, Feedback)
   ☐ Create users on player.html
   ☐ Play a game and finish it
   ☐ Check if score appears on leaderboard
   ☐ Submit feedback form
   ☐ Open browser console (F12) - check for NO red errors

If everything works locally ✓ → Ready to deploy!

===============================================
PART 2: DEPLOY TO RAILWAY
===============================================

Follow these exact steps:

1. PUSH TO GITHUB:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Math Duel Arena - Ready for deployment"
   
   (Create repo on github.com, then:)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git push -u origin main

2. DEPLOY ON RAILWAY:
   - Go to railway.app
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
   - Select your repository
   - Railway auto-deploys

3. ADD MYSQL DATABASE:
   - In Railway dashboard, click "+ New"
   - Select Database → Add MySQL
   - Wait for it to provision (takes ~30 seconds)

4. CONNECT APP TO DATABASE:
   - Click your web service
   - Go to Variables tab
   - Click on MySQL service to see connection details
   - Add these variables (copy values from MySQL):
     
     DB_HOST = [copy MYSQLHOST]
     DB_USER = [copy MYSQLUSER]  
     DB_PASSWORD = [copy MYSQLPASSWORD]
     DB_NAME = [copy MYSQLDATABASE]
     DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT = 10
     NODE_ENV = production

5. CREATE DATABASE TABLES:
   - Click MySQL service → Data/Query tab
   - Open database_setup.sql on your computer
   - Copy ALL the SQL code
   - Paste in Railway query editor
   - Run/Execute
   - Should see: "Query successful" or similar

6. GET YOUR URL:
   - Click web service → Settings
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - You'll get: https://something.up.railway.app
   - SAVE THIS URL FOR SUBMISSION!

Open your Railway URL in browser and test:

1. BASIC LOADING TEST:
   ☐ Homepage loads without errors
   ☐ All CSS and images load properly
   ☐ Navigation works between pages

2. DATABASE CONNECTION TEST:
   ☐ Go to player.html

   ☐ Fill out and submit the form
   ☐ Should see success message

6. VERIFY DATABASE DATA:
   ☐ Go back to Railway → MySQL service
   ☐ Go to Data tab
   ☐ Check tables: users, scores, feedback
   ☐ Your test data should be there!

7. CHECK FOR ERRORS:
   ☐ Open browser DevTools (F12)
   ☐ Go to Console tab
   ☐ Should have NO red errors
   ☐ If there are errors, copy them and check Railway logs

PART 4: IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK
===============================================

Problem: App won't load at all (404 or 503)
Fix: 
- Go to Railway → Your service → Deployments
- Check if build succeeded
- Click on latest deployment → View Logs
- Look for error messages

Problem: "Database connection error"
Fix:
- Railway → Web service → Variables
- Make sure all DB_ variables are set correctly
- Compare with MySQL service connection details
- Redeploy if you changed variables

Problem: App loads but features don't work
Fix:
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for API errors (red text)
- Check if URLs are correct (not localhost)
- Go to Railway logs to see server errors

Problem: Tables don't exist
Fix:
- Railway → MySQL service → Query tab
- Re-run database_setup.sql
- Make sure all CREATE TABLE statements executed

Problem: Changes not showing up
Fix:
- Make sure you pushed to GitHub (git push)
- Railway deploys from GitHub automatically
- Check Railway → Deployments to see if new deploy triggered
